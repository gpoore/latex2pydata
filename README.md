# `latex2pydata` â€“ send data from LaTeX to Python using Python literal format


`latex2pydata` allows [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to save data to
file using
[Python literal syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals),
and provides a Python library for loading this data in Python.  It consists of
two parts:

* The `latex2pydata` LaTeX package, under `latex/` in this repository with its
  own  documentation.  The LaTeX package is available for installation through
  [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/latex2pydata).

* The `latex2pydata` Python package, under `python/` in this repository with
  its own  documentation.  The Python package is available for installation
  through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/latex2pydata/).
